**PLUTUS - open source stock screener**
===================
## Overview

This is the main API for the PLUTUS stock screener.
API documentation will be created in the near future.

## What is PLUTUS-OSS?

PLUTUS-OSS is a project for screening stocks with different filters like P/E Ratio, ROE, Net-to-Debt, etc. . In the beginning it will cover Germany and later Europe. 
The focus of the stock screener is fundamental data, maybe later we will add technical analysis.

The source for the data are the individual annual reports of the companies.

It is made using Django and the Django Rest Framework.
